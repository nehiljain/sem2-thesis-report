\section{Introduction}

In this report I focus on two aspects of my work. First will be the techniques used to enhance Walking Straight Application using Computer Vision. Later, I shall describe the work on Real-Time Emergency Response: Modern Tools for Modern Disasters.

\section{Walking straight}
\label{sec:xrefs}

Walking without vision, results in veering, an inability to maintain a straight path that has important consequences. This is a well-known problem. Many studies have been done on this and proved the veering effect. The reason is not certain but is hypothesized to be motor error in stepping movement.  Blind people have the same problem. This makes crossing intersections and walking straight dangerous and unsafe.
‘Walking Straight’ a application for the smartphone device was developed.[3] It uses the available hardware on a smartphone device, the iPhone 4 to provide real-time audio feedback to the blind users to correct their deviation. The application is built using the ISAS (In-Situ Audio Services) [1] system architecture. The application uses compass and gyroscope sensors to calculate the deviation from a straight path. The values from the sensors are filtered to remove body sway of a person while walking. Different auditory feedback designs were evaluated experimentally and their performance was evaluated. A continuous tone played in the ear in the side of the deviation is concluded to be the most efficient way of rendering the audio feedback to the blind. [3].

\section{Are the sensors reliable?}

The reliability of today’s smartphone sensors was done.[4----sensors study] The current state of walking straight algorithm assumes a stable 10Hz Gyroscope. It solely depends on the sensors to calculate the heading.  
Captoins is mising
The other two sensors are Compass and Gyroscope. Figure 2 indicates compass values (cyan) against ground truth (black), the latter of which is constant (horizontal) for each straight-line leg of the walk. Actual compass error (red) is calculated as the absolute difference between these two, whereas reported compass error (grey) is an estimate of error magnitude by the sensor itself. As can be seen, the actual error fluctuates both above and below the estimate. Gaps in the plot represent transitions between legs of the walk, during which we have no ground truth heading information.
Yaw (green), obtained from the gyro sensor, is not calibrated to north, so this only represents relative variation. This data is should be a flat line, excepting body sway while walking. Slope in yaw indicates drift, observed in all legs of this walk. The reported course (purple) is derived from the direction of travel based on previous location updates. Both the iPhone and Android devices report course and speed based on location changes, but these appear to be of limited use even in the constrained straight-line testing we performed. [2] The inaccurate results of this study point that our application cannot reply on these sensors solely.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Before using this template, make sure you check with
		your supervisor.
	\item MUN's library provides electronic access to some \LaTeX{}
		related textbooks which can be read online.  Use
		the search term \texttt{latex (computer file)} on the
		Library's web page.
	\item If you run into a problem, Google may be a helpful resource.
	\item Concentrate on content, let \LaTeX{} handle the typesetting.
	\item Don't worry about warnings related to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item overfull \texttt{hboxes}/\texttt{boxes}
		\item underfull \texttt{hboxes}/\texttt{vboxes}
	\end{itemize}
	These can be corrected with modest rewording of your text prior
	to submission of your final copy.
\end{itemize}

\section{The \texttt{Makefile}}

You can use \texttt{make} to ``build'' your thesis on the Linux command
line\munfootnote{Linux is available on all machines running LabNet in
\textsl{The Commons} and in other computer labs on campus.} This will
automatically run the \texttt{bibtex} program to create your bibliography
and will also re-run \texttt{latex} as necessary to ensure that all
references are resolved.  A device independent file (\texttt{thesis.dvi})
will be created, by default.  If you are using this template in another
environment other than the Linux command line, then the \texttt{Makefile}
will probably not be useful to you.

\begin{itemize}
\item To make a PostScript copy of your thesis, type the following
at the command line:

\texttt{make thesis.ps}

\item To generate a PDF copy of your thesis, run:

\texttt{make thesis.pdf}

\item To generate a PDF/A-1b copy of your thesis (which should
satisfy the SGS's ethesis submission requirements):

\texttt{make ethesis.pdf}

\item To remove all the files generated by \texttt{bibtex} and
\texttt{latex}, use the command:

\texttt{make clean}

\item To remove the intermediate files, but leave the PostScript
and DVI/PDF files intact, use the command:

\texttt{make neat}
\end{itemize}

As you add or remove figures, chapters, or appendices to your thesis,
make sure you keep the \texttt{Makefile} upto date, too (see the
\texttt{FIGURES} and \texttt{FILES} macros in the \texttt{Makefile}).

\section{Changing Fonts}

Change fonts: {\Large Large},
\verb+verbatim ~@#$%^&*(){}[]+,
\textsc{Small Caps},
\textsl{slanted text},
\emph{emphasized text},
\texttt{typewriter text}.

\section{Some Lists}

Here is a nested enumeration:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item An enumerated list of items.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item which can 
		\item nest
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item to arbitrary
			\item levels
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item More items
	\item in the top
	\item level list.
\end{enumerate}
Another enumeration:
\begin{enumerate}
